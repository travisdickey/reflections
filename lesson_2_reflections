What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- You have to run git init, which initializes a repository. To track changes to files you have to run git add to add files to the staging area.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is a place to save changes before committing them, allowing you the opportunity to keep all commits to a single logical change.
